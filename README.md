These are some of my homework assignments for Mobile Programming I and II that I have taken back in my bachelor's degree.

The Taxi Stop app that is mentioned in the Mobile Programming II Report is lost to time. The API for the same homework is also dead. I might uncover the app itself in the future if I get back my HDD back from home.

All the other apps, except for Book Database and Screentime has demos in their README files. Check the individual folders to see those.
